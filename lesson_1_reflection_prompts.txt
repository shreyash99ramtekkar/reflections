How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   By viewing the different version of a file i was able to easily find the difference
   where i have done wrong. and why my code isnt working.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If i am trying out the new idea in the programming code and then after 
    trying it out i get it is not working and i want to get back to the 
    original code which was before writing the code of the idea.then the
    histroy of the file can help me to get the old code.   

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 pros
    1.we can have limited version.So we can understand quckly what changes 
      has been made.
    2.we can add commit messages so that we can understand easily what part
      has changed.
 cons
    1.if we forgot to commit we may loss some of the changes.at such time the 
      version control system having automatically saved feature comes in handy
    2.if it is saving automatically we dont have to care if the hard drive 
      get crash. we have already saved version available on git.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

The programmer most of the time modifies the code in two or more files and while in the Google docs we modify only one file for a small change and they are not connected to different file.    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 i can use first git log to view the differet version of the files which i have commited. then i have to find the files id of which we have made the changes. then i can use the git diff command to find out the lines which are added and deleated from the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

     by using version control i can find in which specific version my bug was introduce by checking the previous version of the code that was running properly.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  i will use git to manage my workspace for web applications.to explore different things by trying new code and restoring the old one.
