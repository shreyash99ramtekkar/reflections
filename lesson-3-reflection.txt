When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
i would want remote repository when i want to share my project with more that one people. so they can download the lattest commits i
have made to my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

if i am working on a feature on local git repository but since it is not complete i have not push it  to the remote.when i again log on my sytem to work on that feature then if git is automatically pulling changes then my new feature can be deleted. thats why pulling changes manually from remote is better.
